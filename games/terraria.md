## How to use tModLoader with cracked Terraria

1. Make sure your Terraria launches and works properly before installing tModLoader

2. Download the newest version of HxD and tModLoader ( both can be found with a quick google search )

3. Create a new folder inside the Terraria folder (name doesn't matter) and put the insides of the tModLoader zip file you downloaded in

4. Copy the Contents folder, steam_api and CSteamworks from the Terraria folder into tModLoader folder you just created, when prompted pick Skip All, any other option would send you into a hurricane of errors

5. Find any Hash Checker website, drop in the steam_api from the Terraria folder (refer to notes and general directions if missing) and copy the hash string (will be a mess of numbers and capital letters, 32 characters long, encoding should be set to MD5)

6. Open tModLoader in HxD, press CTRL + R, input 7B857C897BC69313E4936DC3DCCE5193 into the top field and the string you got from the previous step into the bottom one. Choose the encoding to be Unicode, search directions to All, press Replace All and then Save

7. If you have done everything right, after starting tModLoader it should launch without any error messages in 10-60 seconds. This delay only appears on first start

## Modding help:

If you're unable to complete step 3 due to both dlls missing in the terraria folder, get the CSteamworks dll off the internet and the api from this google drive link [drive.google.com/...](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zjv9CGIlYMJuKmi2bUKn8MRejuzw0se6/view?usp=sharing)

The hash checker I use is called onlinemd5 , you can find it on google

To get a fresh version of tML find their official website (not steam page) and click on releases
